# Slippery Dogs
Allows you to change the sliding speed and duration of MouthDogs after they lunged at you.

You might not ever see it in action, or you might become a mid-drift snack for a dog that forgot to switch into his snow tires.

Should support other dog mods assuming they dont completely overhaul the AI. Every connected player should have this mod installed.

## Config Settings
All available mod settings can be found in the config file: `dummy.SlipperyDogs.cfg`

The vanilla setting is how it works in the unmodded game (but then you can also just disable this mod).

- **SlideDuration** (default = 5)
	- Duration of the slide after a lunge in seconds. For vanilla settings set this to 2.3.
- **TopSpeed** (default = 15)
    - Starting speed of the lunge. For vanilla settings, set this to 13.
- **AlwaysTopSpeed** (default = true)
	- If the whole slide is at top speed. For vanilla settings, set this to false.

For a truly chaotic experience: set the SlideDuration to 1 or lower.

## Changelog

### 1.0.1
Updated the readme so the intent of the mod is clearer.
Also set the default config settings to be different from the base-game. Now you can just install and play!
